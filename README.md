# Gaggiuino LegoPCB


![Fully Populated](/PCB/Images/LegoPCB-Populated_Top_Render.png)

Gaggiuino has two options for assembly, "Lego" and PCB. While a nice case is available for the Lego components, there is not a good way to keep it looking clean. The primary objective of this project is to provide an option of using the Lego components, with minimal modifiction, and avoid the interconnected wire mess. LegoPCB effectively provides a wire harness on a PCB for the most of the Lego components. An SSR has been substituted as the relay used for the solenoid valve.
