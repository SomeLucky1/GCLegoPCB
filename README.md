# Gaggiuino LegoPCB

Gaggiuino has two options for assembly, "Lego" or PCB. While a nice case is available for the Lego components, there is not a good way to keep it looking clean. The primary objective of this project is to provide an option of using the Lego components, with minimal modifiction, to avoid the interconnected wire mess. LegoPCB effectively provides a wire harness on a PCB for the most of the Lego components. An SSR is use in place of the mechanical relay for the solenoid valve.
